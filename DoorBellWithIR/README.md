DoorBellWithIR is making DIY door bell with infrared remote control.

1. Status can be set by the remote control.
2. Ring the door bell with LED light after pressing the button.

Note: Fixed a bug, the IR sensor cannot connect to the ground in Arduino board but to a common ground in the breadboard.
